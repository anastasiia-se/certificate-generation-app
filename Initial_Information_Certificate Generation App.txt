   - Generate a PDF certificate based on a template with Name, Surname, and current date
   - Send the certificate via email to the provided address
   - Store record in database for admin tracking
3. **Admin Dashboard**: View all issued certificates over time
4. **Hosting**: Deployed on Azure (employer's cloud provider)
